## Project Description

The goal of this project is to practice what we have learned in the Business Intelligence chapter of program. For this project, we have choosen a marketing data set from Kaggle, explored it using Tableau, and put together a Story showing the insights we have derived from the data.


## Workflow
The steps followed to complete the project were:
##### Dataset
1. Import the data set Marketing-data. 
2. Clean up the data set and prepare it to be analyzed.
3. Export data set as a clean CSV data file

##### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Are there any null values or outliers? How will we handle them?
2. Are there any useful variables that we can engineer with the given data?
3. Do we notice any patterns or anomalies in the data? 

##### Data Visualization
1. Which marketing campaign is most successful?
2. What does the average customer look like for this company?
3. Which products are performing best?
4. Which channels are underperforming?


## Organization
